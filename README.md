## Description
- Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB) is an efficient cross-platform similarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of similarity search methods. The core-library does not have any third-party dependencies.
- For ditk I have created a wrapper for NMSLIB to easily use their state of the art Hierarchical Navigable World graph (HNSW) implementation. 



## Functions 

### __init__
####
- Can pass all parameters needed during training/predicting/evaluating

### read_dataset
####
- Can pass path to csv file or dataset name from http://vectors.erikbern.com
- Can specify if read dataset is the train, test, or labels dataset
- Returns a pandas dataframe 

### train
####
- Takes dataframe of vectors and builds ‘num_trees’ annoy search trees
- Parameters passed in will override any predefined class member variables
- Returns annoy model

### predict
####
- Takes dataframe of vectors to predict
- Parameters passed in will override any predefined class member variables
- Returns [[Nearest Neighbor ids],[Distances]] or [[Nearest Neighbor Ids]] if include_distances = False

### evaluate
####
- Takes dataframe of ground truth neighbors and dataframe of vectors to evaluate
- Parameters passed in will override any predefined class member variables
- Returns precision, recall, and reduction ratio

## Evalution
- Benchmark datasets
- Evaluation metrics and results

## Demo
### Jupyter Notebook
